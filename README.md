### *Machine Learning in Genomics*

- [deep_learning_DNA](https://github.com/onceupon/deep_learning_DNA) - Classifying human DNA sequence and random ATCG sequences, using keras CNN
- [DeepMod](https://github.com/WGLab/DeepMod) - takes long-read signals as input and outputs modification summary for each genomic position in a reference genome together with modification prediction for each base in a long read. 
- [janggu](https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/janggu) - a python package that facilitates deep learning in the context of genomics
- [genomelake](https://github.com/kundajelab/genomelake) 
- [deepvariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant) - deep learning-based variant caller
